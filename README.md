Project Around The U.S. Â©Tripleten

Welcome to my project, made with HTML and CSS.

~ ~

The main idea of the page is an interactive layout where users can add, remove, and like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profiles.g
The principal objective of this project was to be able to make a responsive design for the webpage, modifying the vh and making it interactive to use either on a regular computer, a tablet or a smartphone.
